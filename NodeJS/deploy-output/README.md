# Description

This application references a Templater Bot data source (e.g. a Google Spreadsheet) and uploads Templater output assets generated by to a cloud-based storage service, then stages that uploaded asset to a streaming provider and populates the original data source with a URL to share or embed.


# Requirements

You must have Adobe After Effects and Templater Bot installed to use this application.

As of version 1.0.0 this application supports the following vendor services.
  
|Data Source Types    |Cloud Storage     | Video Streaming     |
|:--------------------|:-----------------|:--------------------|
| Google Sheets       |Amazon S3         | JWPlatform          | 

Of course, we want to support more vendor services, so we would never turn down a contribution or pull request from any of you.  If you are so inclined to help with this, please do not hesitate!

### Setup & Security
As a matter of security, you must obtain the following security credentials from the vendors services above.

1.  **Google Service Account**
	+ Read more about [Google Services Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts), [Getting Started with Authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) and [Setting Up Authentication for Server to Server Production Applications](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#auth-cloud-implicit-nodejs)
	+ Create a new project in the [Google Cloud Platform API Console](https://cloud.google.com/) and a Google Service Account email address 
	+ Download the credential file associated with your Google Service Account
	+ Share any Google Sheet document with the Google Service Account email address
      
2.  **JWPlatform**
	+ [Register for a user account on JWPlatform](https://developer.jwplayer.com/)
	+ Find your account's API Key and Secret in your Account dashboard, under the "Account" area
	+ Create a video player on JWPlatform, and note the hash id of the player you created.

3.  **Amazon Web Services SDK**
	+ Create and retrieve your Amazon Web Services IAM user *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key*
	+ [Install and configure the AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) on any machine that runs this application
	+ Retrieve your AWS [IAM *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key*](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
	+ [Create an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html) and a folder that within that buck both of which have write permissions for your IAM user account.

4.  **Credential Files**<br/>
Fill in or replace the credential files for specific vendor services.  You can find placeholder files in this repository
	+ `google-service-account-creds.json` which can be downloaded from the Google Cloud Platform Console under your Google Service Accounts.
	+ `aws-credentials.json` which you can modify with your AWS IAM *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key*
	+ `jwplatform-credentials.json` which you can modify with your JWPlatform account username, API key, and API secret.

5.  **Google Sheet**
	+ Share the Google Sheet document that Templater will be using as a data source with the Google Service Account email address issued to you when you created the Google Services Account on the Google Cloud Platform API console.  The email account might look like the following `my-video-uploader@mycompany.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
	+ Add the following columns to the Google Sheet worksheet that is mapped to the elements within the After Effects template.

		+ `output` — if you don't already have one, create an output column and populate each cell in this column with the name of the file that you want for each specific video.  This application uses the names in these cells when getting the file on disk.
		+ `s3-link` — the cells under this column store URLs to the assets  uploaded to your S3 bucket
		+ `broadcast-status` — the cells under this column store the status of the video on the JWPlatform.  The only value that this application currently inserts into these cells is `created`.
		+ `stream-key` — the cells under this column store a hash id that JWPlatform responds with when a video asset it transferred to it.  Each video in your JWPlatform account has a unique key assigned to it and these cells will store that key.
		+ `broadcast-preview` — the cells under this column will store URLs to a screening page.  You may or may not have a screening page setup, so the values in this column may not be accurate
		+ `embed-script` — the cells under this column will store HTML `<script>` elements that allow you to use in any webpage. For this to work, you will need to get the key code for a player that you created on JWPlatform.  Learn more about players on JWPlatform.

	+ Add a new worksheet to the Google Sheet document to store global variables that will be referenced from the cells in the columns you just created.  You need at least three cells to store variables for: (1) the screening page domain, (2) the screening page route, and (3) the JWPlatform player key you want to use.  For example, the worksheet might look like the following:

		|		|A                     |B                 | C                   |
		|:------|:---------------------|:-----------------|:--------------------|
		|1		|Preview Domain        |Preview Route     | Player Key          |
		|2		|playback.dataclay.com |video             | qEngXmKl            | 


	+ Take note as to the cell reference for each of the cells above.  For example, you can refer to the *Preview Domain* value in row 2 of a worksheet named `streaming_globals` is the following `streaming_globals!A2`.  You will use these referents in the command line arguments.


# Usage

1.  Clone this repository, and run `npm install` to install all required code dependencies into your working directory.

2.  Type out the command line incantation that will be inserted into Templater's *After Each Job* event registration field.  Save it somewhere in order to copy and paste it in the next step.  See below for the definitions of each argument that you can pass to this application.

3.  Copy the command line incantation you typed out in the previous step, and register it with the *After Each Job* event.  You do this either inside of Templater's preferences dialog or the `templater-options.json` file if using Templater's command line interface.  See [Registering scripts with events](https://github.com/dataclay/event-scripts#registering-scripts-with-events) for more information about registering scripts with Templater events.

5.  Decide on a batch of rows from your Google Sheet data source that Templater will begin to process.  Then enter the start row and end row into the `Render row _____ through _____` interface fields in Templater's main panel, or in the `row_start` and `row_end` properties in the `templater-options.json` file if using the Templater CLI.

6.  Execute a batch **rendering** process.  This script will only work properly when rendering directly out of After Effects as opposed to using the **replication** method of output.

7.  Watch the magic happen.  Templater will render output then, upload its output asset to S3, call JWPlatform, and then update the Google Spreadsheet with data from both AWS and JWPlatform.
